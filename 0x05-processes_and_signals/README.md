# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* What is a PID
* What is a process
* How to find a processâ€™ PID
* How to kill a process
* What is a signal
* What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* You are not allowed to use `awk`
* Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
