# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## OSI Model
* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized
## What is a LAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
## What is a WAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
## What is the Internet
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is `localhost`
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created
## TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your Bash script files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* Your Bash script must pass `shellcheck` without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

# More Info
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

For multiple choice question type tasks, just type the number of the correct answer in your answer file, add a new line for every new answer,
